# News-Summarization

** Objective

The objective of this project is to have an efficient tool that can summarize any given article (sentences) into a specific predefined number of sentences in a way that is meaningful and readable. To do so, we are using the two main summarization approaches: extractive and abstractive summarization. In addition, the results of each approach is somehow compared to a related ground-truth summaries according to its type. The comparison metric is rouge which is a n-gram metric used for similarities.

** Project Files

The project files contains the YouTube link for the video presentation, the presentation slides in PDF format and four notebooks as follows:

(Extractive_Summarization.ipynb): for TF-IDF implementation and testing.
(Text_Rank_Extractive.ipynb): for TextRank implementation and testing.
(SEQ2SEQ.ipynb): for seq2seq abstractive model.
(Pretrained_abstractive_models.ipynb): for the pretrained models and testing them.
** Individuals Contributions

As a team, the workload was equally distributed between the team members. Although the fact that each one was assigned to a specific task, continuous supervision and feedback were given from each team member for each task. Here is a summary of the workload distribution.
